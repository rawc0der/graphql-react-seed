# Graphql NodeJS Server

This repository contains the final project for the [**GraphQL.js tutorial**](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/) on [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/). Note that it also serves as foundation for all frontend tutorials on the site.

## Usage

### 1. Clone repository & install dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/howtographql/graphql-js  
cd graphql-js
yarn install # or `npm install`
```

### 2. Install the Prisma CLI

```sh
yarn global add prisma
```

### 3. Deploy the Prisma database service

```sh
prisma deploy
```

When prompted where (i.e. to which Prisma server) you want to deploy your service, choose the **Demo server** which can be used for free in Prisma Cloud. If you haven't done so already, you will be asked to register with Prisma Cloud (which you can do via GitHub). For the following prompts in the terminal you can select the suggested values by hitting Enter. (If you have Docker installed, you can also choose to deploy Prisma locally by creating a new database.)

### 4. Start the server & open Playground

To interact with the API in a GraphQL Playground, all you need to do is execute the `start` script defined in `package.json`:

```sh
yarn start
```

# React & Apollo Tutorial

This is the sample project that belongs to the [React & Apollo Tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/) on How to GraphQL.

## How to use

### 1. Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/howtographql/react-apollo/
```

### 2. Install dependencies & Deploy the Prisma database API

```sh
cd react-apollo/server
yarn install
yarn prisma deploy
```

Then, follow these steps in the interactive CLI wizard:

1. Select **Demo server**
1. **Authenticate** with Prisma Cloud in your browser (if necessary)
1. Back in your terminal, **confirm all suggested values**

<details>
 <summary>Alternative: Run Prisma locally via Docker</summary>

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can get it from [here](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition).
1. Create `docker-compose.yml` for MySQL (see [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-server/database-connector-POSTGRES-jgfr/) for Postgres):
    ```yml
    version: '3'
    services:
      prisma:
        image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.23
        restart: always
        ports:
        - "4466:4466"
        environment:
          PRISMA_CONFIG: |
            port: 4466
            databases:
              default:
                connector: mysql
                host: mysql
                port: 3306
                user: root
                password: prisma
                migrations: true
      mysql:
        image: mysql:5.7
        restart: always
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: prisma
        volumes:
          - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    volumes:
      mysql:
    ```
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`
1. Run `prisma deploy`

</details>

### 3. Start the server

To start the server, all you need to do is execute the `start` script by running the following command inside the `server` directory:

```sh
yarn start
```

> **Note**: If you want to interact with the GraphQL API of the server inside a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground), you can navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

### 4. Run the app

Now that the server is running, you can start the React app as well. The commands need to be run in a new terminal tab/window inside the root directory `react-apollo` (because the current tab is blocked by the process running the server):

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can now open your browser and use the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
